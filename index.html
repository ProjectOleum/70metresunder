             <p class="light orange-text text-lighten-4"> What would become one of Canada’s most valuable economic resources was deemed worthless at first glance.<br>
&ensp;&ensp; In 1719, a Cree man named Wapasu brought a sample of bitumen to Henry Kelsey, a Hudson Bay Company explorer. Bitumen -- a dark, tarlike substance composed of sand, clay, oil and water -- would naturally seep out of the Athabasca River banks, its presence long known by Aboriginal Peoples in Canada. Wapasu’s sample, which was likely the first bitumen encountered by Europeans, was considered useless.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Three centuries later, bitumen has proven its worth on a global scale. The oil sands play a dominant part in Canada’s energy sector and the oil harvested from the sands comprises 97 per cent of Canada’s proven oil reserves. Oil is in constant global demand, and Canada has heavily invested and exploited its oil sands to meet that growing need.</p>

          <p class="light orange-text text-lighten-4">
  &ensp;&ensp;Bitumen is economically valuable, in high demand and available for extraction. It’s proponents call it a natural resource meant to be utilized for the good of the Canadian economy; it’s critics call it an environmental nightmare and an exploitation of Canada’s natural resources.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stoked the flames of debate earlier this year when he publicly called for the oil sands to be “phased out.” He later retracted the statement, but the anger and the questions sparked by his remark illustrate depth of support and concern the oil sands raise in Canadians.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Three hundred years ago, a European explorer discovering the natural and vast country that would become Canada called bitumen worthless. Today, no one would make such a mistake.

          <h4 class="header col s12 orange-text text-lighten-4">What are the Oil Sands</h4>

        <div  id="section2" class=" col s6 scrollspy">
          <div class="icon-block">
            <h2 class="center orange-text text-lighten-4"><i class="material-icons">track_changes</i></h2>
            <h5 class="center orange-text text-lighten-4">A Resource Like No Other</h5>

            <p class="light orange-text text-lighten-4">Canada is known for its plethora of natural resources - vast forests of green, plentiful waterways tangling the landscape, rolling plains of golden wheat. Metres under the surface of the oil sands, often underneath tons of soil, rock and plantlife, lies bitumen - a resource unlike the rest.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“I think for the longest time we have moved from one natural resource to another,” said Stephen Scott, Carleton University’s graduate supervisor of sustainable energy policy. “If you look at the history of Canada, it’s kind of a staples approach; going from cart to beaver pelts to lumber then oil, natural gas. Just taking stuff out of the ground - lots of mining and selling it raw to the world.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Oil is found around the globe, but the oil sands are more unique in nature. The world’s largest oil sands are found in Canada and Venezuela, with smaller pockets found in the United States, Russia, Madagascar and the Republic of Congo.
Bitumen is a heavy oil. Difficult to extract from both the ground it is in and the sand and clay the oil is mixed with, bitumen presented a challenge to those wanting to extract the valuable oil it contained. Unlike bitumen’s cousin, crude oil, which flows freely and is found in a purer form, bitumen requires purification and warming before resembling the oil within.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Oil sands were created millennia ago, when shifting tectonic plates formed the Rocky Mountains and in turn buried the sedimentary rock layers under Alberta. The result was a pressure cooker of heat that transformed shale rock into natural gas and light oil. Because of plate shifting and pinching underground, a tilted tectonic plate allowed light oil to migrate north. There, where the future oil sands would form, microbial biodegradation thicked and immobilized the oil in Northern Alberta.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Bitumen remained untouched in the oil sands for centuries, tucked deep within the earth, protected by shale and rock and soil. Small dribbles would escape along waterways, where Indigenous Peoples would use the tar-like substance to waterproof their canoes. Early European explorers discounted bitumen, but later pioneers and government researchers realized the commercial possibilities contained in the oil sands.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;The process of extracting oil from the oil sands is complex because of the resources’ impurities and surface depth.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp; Bitumen closer to the surface can be extracted by way of open pit mining. Once bitumen is discovered, the land is cleared and bitumen is shoveled up. The bitumen is then crushed and pumped with hot water for transport to the settling basin, or tailing pond. There, the wet mixture is allowed to settle: bitumen froth rises to the separation vessel’s surface and the sediments - rock and clay - sink to the bottom. The bitumen can then be collected for future upgrading and refining. While the bitumen is extracted, the remnants of the extraction process remain in tailing ponds: most ponds are re-used, but the landscape is indefinitely changed throughout the process. A significant portion of the water can be recycled, but requires treatment to cleanse it.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;The majority of the oil sands - around 80 per cent - are too deep for surface mining. Bitumen with a surface depth of 130 metres or more is extracted using in-situ (or in-place) techniques, which disturb the earth’s surface to a lesser degree than open pit mining. Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the most used method of in-situ mining, recovering 55 to 60 per cent of extractable bitumen. Two parallel wells are drilled, one higher than the other. The higher injection well continually inserts steam into the ground, heating the bitumen and allowing it to become more fluid. The liquid bitumen flows lower and is brought into the lower well, collected with pumps and transported for upgrading.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;The extraction process’ environmental impact is the main argument critics raise against the oil sands.</p>
  <ul class="light orange-text text-lighten-4">
    <li>Extracting bitumen is carbon intensive, and compared to conventional crude oil, greenhouse gas emissions from the Albertan oil sands are an estimated 5 to fifteen per cent higher.</li>
    <li>Oil sands industry produces 8.5 per cent of Canada’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and 0.12 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Separating bitumen requires a significant amount of water - for every barrel of oil produced, 0.4 barrels of freshwater is needed.</li>
    <li>Environmentalists also raise concerns that open pit mining destroys ecosystems when the land is cleared, and that tar sands are detrimental to the environment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="light orange-text text-lighten-4">Controversy over the oil sands, and an understanding of their vital importance to the Canadian economy, is not soon to fade. Bitumen’s utility as a transportation product began with Indigenous Peoples, and stretches into the modern day.</p>

                  As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found out, ‘phasing out’ the oil sands is not a simple proposition. <br>
  &ensp;&ensp;The argument against the oil sands is simple: they’re detrimental to the environment and they tie Canada’s economy to an unsustainable resource.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;  The vitality of the oil industry to the Canadian dollar personifies itself in the dollar’s nickname - the oil loonie. Employment, economic success, the dollar, equalization payments between the provinces, the price of oil: all those factors are tied into the oil industry’s success, and with it, Canada’s.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;  The oil industry is one of Canada’s largest employers, with 400,000 people employed in the oil industry or one of its support sectors. In 2014, royalties from synthetic crude oil and bitumen accounted for nearly 55 per cent of Alberta’s non-renewable resource revenue. Between 1999 and 2013, $201 billion was invested in the industry.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“Until there’s a natural resource that can replace oil as we know it today, it’s our most valuable asset, and not just in Western Canada,” said Keith McGrath, a ward councillor for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes the city of Fort McMurray. “Look at the oil we’re taking out of the bottom of the ocean in Atlantic Canada, and it’s valuable for everybody. It creates jobs, it gives people healthcare, it gives people education, it’s a full, real deal.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Of the world’s oil reserves, 80 per cent are owned by governments or government-owned oil companies. Canada’s oil sands represent 50 per cent of the remaining 20 per cent open for investment.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“Across Alberta, [oil is] the industry that determines almost all of our livelihoods,” said Andrew Leach, an environmental economist at the University of Alberta and chair of Alberta’s 2015 Climate Change Advisory Panel. “So in the period that we’ve seen recently, you’ve had a significant employment downturn and increase in unemployment rates. Beyond that, what you’ve seen is a very large labour market impact concentrated in particular areas and particular skillsets.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Low oil prices have slowed down Alberta’s economy, and the province is suffering from job loss and slow growth. A government worker or teacher in Edmonton is not as impacted by the downturn as a rig worker in Red Deer might be, said Leach.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“So you have this serious hit that is also very unevenly distributed through the province.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Alberta might be most significantly hit by hard times in the oil industry, but the effects are nationwide. When Fort McMurray was ravaged by a massive wildfire that forced regional evacuations and temporarily halted oil production, Canada’s GDP dropped significantly. The second quarter of 2016 saw Canada’s worst performance since the 2008 recession, with the GDP falling 1.6 per cent in a single quarter.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Canada’s equalization payment system -- which dubs some provinces as have provinces and some as have not provinces -- is meant to spread the wealth equitably across Canada. The federal government makes payments to have not provinces, and does not make payments to have provinces.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Alberta hasn’t received an equalization payment since 1963.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“Alberta...has sent out $12 billion in equalization payments to the rest of the country,” said Robert Hage, a former Canadian diplomat and Principal Counsel for the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. “So it’s not just Alberta that has been affected by the downturn. It’s the whole country: our dollar has dropped, the demands on the canadian manufacturing sector after the recession has been hit hard and hasn’t been able to fill in the gap that has been left by the decline of oil resources.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;For Albertans, the oil industry can be personal. The price of oil - an abstract decimal decided by foreign markets and influences out of their control - can wreak havoc on their livelihoods during poor times and lead to wealth and security during the good.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“When the oil price took a tumble, there was a direct correlation to that and the economy that moved jobs, families were disrupted, it was just a tough time,” said McGrath. “And we’re not out of the woods yet. We’re probably looking at a couple more years of tough times. And certainly when the price of oil tanks, there’s a lot of people that tank with it.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;The oil sands industry relies heavily on transportation concerns. Oil is mined and diluted in Alberta, but the lack of Canadian refineries in the oil sands means that crude oil must be transported -- usually long distances -- to refineries. Oil is currently transported in a variety of ways, including road, train and pipeline. The pipeline question, especially involving Keystone XL, is fraught with political and economic tension. <br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“Now talking about either land, through pipelines, or the sea, through tankers, I think the common thought is that the best thing you can do for transporting oil is to put it in a pipeline,” said Hage.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan Energy Institute, says that the majority of oil spills in North America are “relatively small.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“When you do get a leak in the middle of a pipeline, that tends to spill more,” Barteau said. “And depending on the local environment, whether you’re crossing water, whether you’re crossing an aquifer. And how remote the spill is; if it’s more remote, people may be less affected, but it may take you a while longer to realize what’s happening and to detect it. All of those are part of the equation.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;  Environmentalists consider pipelines to be yet another danger involving the oil sands. The Keystone XL pipeline was controversial, in part, because of its proposed route near the Nebraska sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;  “So we’re basically saying we’re going to be off of fossil fuels by midcentury; it doesn’t make any sense to be building new pipelines, new mines, etcetera, that would have to operate for fifty years in order to be economic,” said Stewart. “We have just over two million barrels worth of production in the oil sands right now, there’s projections to take that to four million or five million barrels per day. That doesn’t make any sense in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels. So first, stop making the problem worse. Stop digging. When you’re in the hole, you stop digging. So no new pipelines, no new mines. No expansion of existing operations.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Phasing out the oil sands and replacing them with more sustainable energies is often floated as a goal.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“In some ways, the oil sands have become -- or has been for a long time -- this thing that’s abstract to a lot of Canadians, and feel like we could just turn it on and off like a switch,” said Leach. “But it’s a large industrial sector, just like the auto industry in Ontario or the lumber industry in parts of Canada, or the agriculture industry in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and Alberta. It’s not something where you say, ‘we’re just going to stop doing that.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;There’s also the question: not if, but when? Scientists have identified global temperatures that will act as a tipping point for climate change, said Schott, and for temperatures to remain under that level, he says two-thirds of oil needs to stay in the ground.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“But we need a plan for Canada that involves the West and involves energy and oil and gas,” he said. “Because we can’t just shut it down. We want to think of how long we want to extract oil and how much we want to keep in the ground.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Some stakeholders, like Greenpeace, support phasing out the oil sands before low oil prices force economic changes out of Canada’s control<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;“We have a choice,” said Keith Stewart, Greenpeace’s senior energy strategist. “We can either manage the transition ourselves in a way that’s going to work for us, or we can let the world markets do it for us. You’ve seen the last few years, for a long time everybody thought the price of oil would always go up, there would always be demand for oil because it’s always going to be a source of income and tax dollars, etcetera. But that faith, I think, has been shaken in the last few years because when the price first dropped, people thought oh this is just a temporary bump, it’ll go right back up. But it hasn’t.”<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;Trudeau ended up retracting his statement about intending to ‘phase out’ the Albertan oil sands.<br>
  &ensp;&ensp;““I misspoke. I said something the way I shouldn’t have said it,” he said. “We know that the transition off of our dependency on fossil fuels is going to take a long time.”
