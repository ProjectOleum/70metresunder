&emsp;&emsp; In 1719, a Cree man named Wapasu brought a sample of bitumen to Henry Kelsey, a Hudson Bay Company explorer. Bitumen -- a dark, tarlike substance composed of sand, clay, oil and water -- naturally seeped out of the Athabasca River banks. The early explorers were charting the region of Canada that would be known, centuries later, as the oil sands, where bitumen lies under the surface. Bitumen’s presence was long known by Aboriginal Peoples in Canada, who used it to waterproof their canoes. Kelsey considered Wapasu’s sample, which was likely to the first bitumen encountered by Europeans, to be useless.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Three centuries later, bitumen has proven its worth on a global scale. The oil sands play a dominant part in Canada’s energy sector and the oil harvested from the sands comprises 97 per cent of Canada’s proven oil reserves. Oil is in constant global demand, and Canada has heavily invested and exploited its oil sands to meet that growing need.</p>

  &emsp;&emsp;Bitumen is economically valuable, in high demand and available for extraction. It’s proponents call it a natural resource meant to be utilized for the good of the Canadian economy; it’s critics call it an environmental nightmare and an exploitation of Canada’s natural resources.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stoked the flames of debate earlier this year when he publicly called for the oil sands to be “phased out.” He later retracted the statement, but the anger and the questions sparked by his remark illustrate depth of support and concern the oil sands raise in Canadians.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Three hundred years ago, a European explorer discovering the natural and vast country that would become Canada called bitumen worthless. Today, no one would make such a mistake.</p>

Metres under the surface of the oil sands, often underneath tons of soil, rock and vegetation, lies bitumen - a resource unlike the rest.</p>

Just taking stuff out of the ground - lots of mining and selling it raw to the world.”</p>

The world’s largest oil sands are found in Canada and Venezuela, with smaller pockets found in the United States, Russia, Madagascar and the Republic of Congo.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Bitumen is a heavy oil. Difficult to extract from both the ground it is in and the sand and clay the oil is mixed with, bitumen presented a challenge to those wanting to extract the valuable oil it contained. Unlike bitumen’s cousin, crude oil, which flows freely and is found in a purer form, bitumen requires purification and warming before resembling the oil within. <br><br><br></p>

                <!--<h2>Where it's found</h2>-->
                <p class="left-align container" style="padding-top:10px;">&emsp;&emsp;Oil sands were created millennia ago, when shifting tectonic plates formed the Rocky Mountains and in turn buried the sedimentary rock layers under Alberta. The result was a pressure cooker of heat that transformed shale rock into natural gas and light oil. Because of plate shifting and pinching underground, a tilted tectonic plate allowed light oil to migrate north. There, where the future oil sands would form, microbial biodegradation thicked and immobilized the oil in Northern Alberta. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
Bitumen remained untouched in the oil sands for centuries, tucked deep within the earth, protected by shale, rock and soil. Small dribbles would escape along waterways, where Indigenous Peoples would use the tar-like substance to waterproof their canoes. Early European explorers discounted bitumen, but later pioneers and government researchers realized the commercial possibilities contained in the oil sands.</p>

                <p class="left-align container" style="padding-top:10px;">&emsp;&emsp;The process of extracting oil from the oil sands is complex because of the resources’ impurities and surface depth. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Bitumen closer to the surface can be extracted by way of open pit mining. Once bitumen is discovered, the land is cleared and bitumen is shoveled up. The bitumen is then crushed and pumped with hot water for transport to the settling basin, or tailing pond. There, the wet mixture is allowed to settle: bitumen froth rises to the separation vessel’s surface and the sediments - rock and clay - sink to the bottom. The bitumen can then be collected for future upgrading and refining. While the bitumen is extracted, the remnants of the extraction process remain in tailing ponds: most ponds are re-used, but the landscape is indefinitely changed throughout the process. A significant portion of the water can be recycled, but requires treatment to cleanse it.

              <p class="left-align container" style="padding-top:10px;">&emsp;The majority of the oil sands — around 80 per cent — are too deep for surface mining. Bitumen with a surface depth of 130 metres or more is extracted using in-situ techniques, which disturb the earth’s surface to a lesser degree than open pit mining. Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the most used method of in-situ mining, recovering 55 to 60 per cent of extractable bitumen. Two parallel wells are drilled, one higher than the other. The higher injection well continually inserts steam into the ground, heating the bitumen and allowing it to become more fluid. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The liquid bitumen flows lower and is brought into the lower well, collected with pumps and transported for upgrading.</p>

              As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found out, ‘phasing out’ the oil sands is not a simple proposition. <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;The argument against the oil sands is simple: they’re detrimental to the environment and they tie Canada’s economy to an unsustainable resource.<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;  The vitality of the oil industry to the Canadian dollar personifies itself in the dollar’s nickname - the oil loonie. Employment, economic success, the dollar, equalization payments between the provinces, the price of oil: all those factors are tied into the oil industry’s success, and with it, Canada’s.

              &emsp;&emsp;  The oil industry is one of Canada’s largest employers, with 400,000 people employed in the oil industry or one of its support sectors. In 2014, royalties from synthetic crude oil and bitumen accounted for nearly 55 per cent of Alberta’s non-renewable resource revenue. Between 1999 and 2013, $201 billion was invested in the industry.<br>

              &emsp;&emsp;“Until there’s a natural resource that can replace oil as we know it today, it’s our most valuable asset, and not just in Western Canada,” said Keith McGrath, a ward councillor for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes the city of Fort McMurray. “Look at the oil we’re taking out of the bottom of the ocean in Atlantic Canada, and it’s valuable for everybody. It creates jobs, it gives people healthcare, it gives people education, it’s a full, real deal.”<br>

              &emsp;&emsp;Of the world’s oil reserves, 80 per cent are owned by governments or government-owned oil companies. Canada’s oil sands represent 50 per cent of the remaining 20 per cent open for investment.<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“Across Alberta, [oil is] the industry that determines almost all of our livelihoods,” said Andrew Leach, an environmental economist at the University of Alberta and chair of Alberta’s 2015 Climate Change Advisory Panel. “So in the period that we’ve seen recently, you’ve had a significant employment downturn and increase in unemployment rates. Beyond that, what you’ve seen is a very large labour market impact concentrated in particular areas and particular skillsets.”<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;Low oil prices have slowed down Alberta’s economy, and the province is suffering from job loss and slow growth. A government worker or teacher in Edmonton is not as impacted by the downturn as a rig worker in Red Deer might be, said Leach.<br><br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“So you have this serious hit that is also very unevenly distributed through the province.”<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;The oil sands industry relies heavily on transportation concerns. Oil is mined and diluted in Alberta, but the lack of Canadian refineries in the oil sands means that crude oil must be transported -- usually long distances -- to refineries. Oil is currently transported in a variety of ways, including road, train and pipeline. The pipeline question, especially involving Keystone XL, is fraught with political and economic tension. <br>

            &emsp;&emsp;“Now talking about either land, through pipelines, or the sea, through tankers, I think the common thought is that the best thing you can do for transporting oil is to put it in a pipeline,” said Hage.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Mark Barteau, director of the University of Michigan Energy Institute, says that the majority of oil spills in North America are “relatively small.”<br></p>

              &emsp;&emsp;Alberta hasn’t received an equalization payment since 1963.<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“Alberta...has sent out $12 billion in equalization payments to the rest of the country,” said Robert Hage, a former Canadian diplomat and Principal Counsel for the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.<br>
              “So it’s not just Alberta that has been affected by the downturn. It’s the whole country: our dollar has dropped, the demands on the canadian manufacturing sector after the recession has been hit hard and hasn’t been able to fill in the gap that has been left by the decline of oil resources.”<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;For Albertans, the oil industry can be personal. The price of oil - an abstract decimal decided by foreign markets and influences out of their control - can wreak havoc on their livelihoods during poor times and lead to wealth and security during the good.<br><br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“When the oil price took a tumble, there was a direct correlation to that and the economy that moved jobs, families were disrupted, it was just a tough time,” said McGrath. “And we’re not out of the woods yet. We’re probably looking at a couple more years of tough times. And certainly when the price of oil tanks, there’s a lot of people that tank with it.”
              <br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“When you do get a leak in the middle of a pipeline, that tends to spill more,” Barteau said. “And depending on the local environment, whether you’re crossing water, whether you’re crossing an aquifer. And how remote the spill is; if it’s more remote, people may be less affected, but it may take you a while longer to realize what’s happening and to detect it. All of those are part of the equation.”<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;  Environmentalists consider pipelines to be yet another danger involving the oil sands. The Keystone XL pipeline was controversial, in part, because of its proposed route near the Nebraska sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer.<br>

              &emsp;&emsp;  “So we’re basically saying we’re going to be off of fossil fuels by midcentury; it doesn’t make any sense to be building new pipelines, new mines, etcetera, that would have to operate for fifty years in order to be economic,” said Stewart. “We have just over two million barrels worth of production in the oil sands right now, there’s projections to take that to four million or five million barrels per day. That doesn’t make any sense in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels. So first, stop making the problem worse. Stop digging. When you’re in the hole, you stop digging. So no new pipelines, no new mines. No expansion of existing operations.”<br> &emsp;&emsp;Phasing out the oil sands and replacing them with more sustainable energies is often floated as a goal.<br>

              &emsp;&emsp;“In some ways, the oil sands have become -- or has been for a long time -- this thing that’s abstract to a lot of Canadians, and feel like we could just turn it on and off like a switch,” said Leach. “But it’s a large industrial sector, just like the auto industry in Ontario or the lumber industry in parts of Canada, or the agriculture industry in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and Alberta. It’s not something where you say, ‘we’re just going to stop doing that.”

              &emsp;&emsp;There’s also the question: not if, but when? Scientists have identified global temperatures that will act as a tipping point for climate change, said Schott, and for temperatures to remain under that level, he says two-thirds of oil needs to stay in the ground.<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;“But we need a plan for Canada that involves the West and involves energy and oil and gas,” he said. “Because we can’t just shut it down. We want to think of how long we want to extract oil and how much we want to keep in the ground.”<br>
              &emsp;&emsp;Some stakeholders, like Greenpeace, support phasing out the oil sands before low oil prices force economic changes out of Canada’s control<br>
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;“We have a choice,” said Keith Stewart, Greenpeace’s senior energy strategist. “We can either manage the transition ourselves in a way that’s going to work for us, or we can let the world markets do it for us.You’ve seen the last few years, for a long time everybody thought the price of oil would always go up, there would always be demand for oil because it’s always going to be a source of income and tax dollars, etcetera.

          </div>
          <div class=" col s12 scrollspy">
            <p class="light orange-text text-lighten-4">
                But that faith, I think, has been shaken in the last few years because when the price first dropped, people thought oh this is just a temporary bump, it’ll go right back up. But it hasn’t.”<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;Trudeau ended up retracting his statement about intending to ‘phase out’ the Albertan oil sands.<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;““I misspoke. I said something the way I shouldn’t have said it,” he said. “We know that the transition off of our dependency on fossil fuels is going to take a long time.”

          <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau found himself in hot water after he told a town hall crowd that "we can't shut down the oilsands tomorrow. We need to phase them out. We need to manage the transition off of our dependence on fossil fuels. That is going to take time. And, in the meantime, we have to manage that transition." He later went on to retract that statement, saying he misspoke and would continue to support Albertans. The backlash to Trudeau’s statement was immediate, but once he reconfirmed his thoughts and apologized, public opinion tempered. <br/>“I think, in all fairness to Justin Trudeau, that was an off moment,” said McGrath.</p>

        <p style="padding-bottom:50px;">Stephen Harper, a prime minister from Alberta and a MP from Calgary, was in support of the oil sands and the oil industry as a whole. During his tenure as prime minister, he was a vocal supporter of pipeline expansion and supported the Canadian energy industry. Harper did, however, sign onto an G7 agreement in 2015 to phase out fossil fuels by 2100 — displaying a willingness to adapt to new, more sustainable energy options.<br><br>
“I think it’s one of those things where [former] Prime Minister Harper said we need to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century, it said different things to different people than when Justin Trudeau says it,” said Leach.</p>

          <p>Thoughts on the oil sands are as diverse as Aboriginal communities themselves. Some Aboriginal communities have struck prosperity after discovering oil on their lands; others have suffered the negative effects of pollution. About 23,000 Aboriginal Peoples live in the oil sands region of Northern Alberta.<br>
“There's a lot of concern in downstream communities, which are primarily First Nation, over the impacts on water, on air and on food from these oil sands operations,” said Stewart. “For a long time the companies denied that the tailing ponds leaked. It’s been proven that they do.”
Aboriginal Peoples have the constitutionally guaranteed right to hunt, fish and trap on their lands. If their food sources are contaminated, Stewart says that is breaking Canada’s treaty-bound agreement with them.<br>
The Government of Canada has compromised <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/pdf/oilsands-sablesbitumineux/14-0696%20Oil%20Sands%20-%20Indigenous%20Peoples_e.pdf"><i class="material-icons">launch</i></a> with Aboriginal Peoples on the oil sands issues in a variety of ways; economically, environmentally and socially.</p>

          <p>““So basically we think three things need to happen. First, we need to stop the expansion of the oil sands. So stop building new pipelines, new mines, new in-situ facilities. Secondly, clean up the existing operations. There’s tailing ponds that leak, there’s all kinds of devastation in the area. And then thirdly, phase out the existing operations of the course of the coming decades. We know we’re not going to be shutting down the tar sands tomorrow, but we have to start doing it now, and that means not building new infrastructure but also having a plan for both workers, communities, in order to get off of oil. Because we need to be off of fossil fuels by midcentury, and that’s going to take a lot of effort around the world, but if we simply wait until the world market sort of forces us to do that, it’s going to be very messy. It’s going to look a lot what happened since the oil price dropped in 2014, whereas we can do this in a much more managed decline approach.” -  Keith Stewart</p>

                <p class="justify-text green-text light text-lighten-2">&emsp;&emsp;A world without oil would look drastically different from the world as we know it today. While most of the oil extracted from the oil sands is used for transportation purposes, oil is used for a vast array of products across the board. A true phase out of oil - whether that happens in ten years, 50 years, a century or even longer - means that sustainable energy would have to replace oil entirely.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Recent pushes for environmental responsibility and the battle against climate change have increased the use of sustainable energies in the Western world. In Canada today, renewable energies account for 18.9 per cent of the country’s total primary energy supply.</p>

              <ul class="collection green-text light text-lighten-2">
                  <li class="collection-item grey darken-2 left-align">- 59.3 per cent of Canada’s electricity generation comes from hydro sources (or moving water).</li>
                  <li class="collection-item grey darken-2 left-align">- 3.5 per cent of Canada’s total energy comes from wind.</li>
                  <li class="collection-item grey darken-2 left-align">- 1.4 per cent of Canada’s total energy comes from biomass sources.</li>
              </ul>


              <p class=" justify-text green-text light text-lighten-2">&emsp;&emsp;Today, energy from wind and solar photovoltaic are the fastest-growing sources of energy in Canada.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Fossil fuels, including bitumen from the oil sands, are not renewable forms of energy. Once they are used, they are gone. Renewable energies, which are also known as clean energies - like solar, wind or water - are constant in presence. They will not run out, like oil one day will.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Canada has entered into domestic and international agreements meant to reinforce the use of sustainable energies. For some, though, that effort is not enough.<br></p>

                &emsp;&emsp;“The government, they want to have their cake and eat it too but they really actually have to make a choice,” said Stewart. “The math doesn’t add up: how can you enable these massive increases in emissions from one sector and achieve the kinds of significant reductions overall that they’re promising? The approvals that they’ve done on pipelines are completely inconsistent with their climate commitments. I think what they’re hoping is that if they just smile enough, and have shiny enough hair, no one will notice.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;But for those working on the oil sands, the prospect of phasing out their livelihood is an unsettling idea. McGrath says that the oil sands are on the leading edge of technology, and the unique and technical skill set of oil sands workers is valuable.<br>
              </p>

                &emsp;&emsp;“We have the smartest people in the world that work on these technologies, and I think the biggest thing is that we don’t get too far hung up,” said McGrath. “We can’t be afraid to diversify our economy by different methods. Whether it’s a renewable energy of some sort, but oil will be here for a long time yet.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;Oil companies make a point of emphasizing their organization’s green energy efforts. Nearly every oil company has a web page about their environmental efforts, and sustainability is widely emphasized. McGrath warns that heightened environmental concerns must be balanced with an awareness of the importance of the oil industry to Canadian livelihoods and employment.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;“I think we’re a long ways away from replacing oil,” he said. “I’m all for sustainability, saying we want to protect the environment. But at the end of the day, you don’t suddenly want to go back to the Great Depression or anything like that. The reality is that we’re a long ways away from replacing oil.”<br>

                     &emsp;&emsp;The drive for sustainable energy arises from concerns that oil’s long-term effects will permanently damage the environment. There is also a concern that we should adopt more sustainable energies while doing so is still a choice, rather than an immediate necessity.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;“People don’t really love oil,” said Stewart. “They don’t love breathing exhaust from cars. If you could get to where you were going in a vehicle that didn’t pollute, say an electric vehicle that’s running on power generated by wind and solar, that’s good for the environment and it’s getting you where you need to go. If we had better public transit systems that were running on clear energy. So I think if people had the options, they will take it. And I think part of what we have to do is accelerate the shift so that people have options that will work for them, where they can have access to clean energy.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;As more and more countries sign onto international climate change agreements and enact stricter emissions policies, renewable energies are coming into mainstream use. Canada’s vast landmass and plentiful natural resources equip the country to exploit natural resources in a renewable way.

          <p> &emsp;&emsp;“Texas, for example, which you might think of as an oil and gas state, is actually the largest producer of wind energy in the United States,” said Barteau. “So I think that we are seeing more and more investment in renewable energy in the U.S., and we will continue to see that. Just to give you a number, since 2008, solar capacity in this country has gone up seventeen-fold, and wind capacity has gone up threefold.”<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Greenpeace would like to see 100 per cent of the globe using renewable energies by 2015.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“That means we’re going to be using energy a lot more efficiently, a lot smarter than we do right now,” said Stewart. “If we use less, and the energy that we do use is coming from sources like the wind and the sun, which never run out, and which don’t cause climate change.”<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;The adaptation of sustainable, cleaner energies deviates from the global norm, and global demand for energy is only increasing. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“We’re probably looking to at least double the world’s energy supply by the end of the century,” said Barteau. “The problem is that we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions well below the levels today. So the challenge is to supply more people with the energy they need, while at the same time, doing that in a way that’s much less CO2 or greenhouse gas intensive.”
  Experts warn that while adopting green energies, we need to stay cognizant of the fact that no energy source is perfect, and that the green paradox can occur. <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“You need to marry these things that make sense,” Hage said. “It’s nice to have wind and solar, but there’s problems with them - the sun has to shine and the wind has to blow and the batteries they’ve developed to store the energy are not perfect yet. So you have to develop that in line with a fossil fuel industry that’s going to be with us, probably, for decades.”<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Barteau does not see the entire globe every completely switching to renewable energy sources.</p>
</div>

<div class="col s6">
“I think we will see more of a shift in the developed world,” he said. “I think there will remain some things, including airplanes - I don’t really want to fly on a battery powered plane. And other things; so I don’t think petroleum fuels will go away completely. I think we’ll see alternatives take a bigger and bigger chunk of the market.”<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;An overwhelming push to phase out oil in favour of more sustainable policies would have to be backed by economic and political efforts and reinforced by public opinion.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“I think what we’ve been really good at for a long time is setting environmental targets that are not backed up by policies,” said Leach. “To me, that’s not just an oil sands problem. You would ask the same question about transportation, you could ask the same question about heating buildings and houses. It’s easy to ask it about the oil sands because it feels like something we could just consciously decide not to do.”<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;One of the main problems that proponents of clean energy encounter is a lack of public support. It’s easy to say one will recycle more, or turn off their lights before leaving home, or will take the bus more often, but adopting long-term sustainable and environmentally friendly habits is easier said than done. When smog was causing problems in Ontario, public support for clean air was high, said Schott, because people could see and feel the effects. With sustainable energy, the picture is different - harder to see with the naked eye.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“The technologies are there,” Schott said, “people are just not switching because they don’t see the urge or the need. There’s not enough push for it. We could easily reduce emissions by 20, 30 per cent in a few years. It’s very doable … But to anticipate what the future will look like and the costs associated with that, and the misery, is harder for people to see.” <br>
  &emsp;&emsp;The misery Schott’s referring to is what some scientists refer to as the ‘catastrophic tipping point’ or the environmental point of no return; after which human-generated climate change will have begun down an unstoppable, irreversible path.<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;“This is something that’s very unpredictable, uncertain,” said Schott. “It's not worth going there...it’s much better to act now. It’s also much cheaper to act now. Once that happens, we’ll spend billions just for one city, to protect them. Now, it’s much cheaper to act. There’s still low-hanging fruit, where it's just clearly inefficient how we waste energy or put carbon in the air.”

          <p class="left-align light center justify-text">Opinions on Canada’s oil sands are as mixed as the substance itself. Exploitative, beneficial, dangerous, valuable, dirty, historic, threatening, sustainable, catastrophic - when it comes to the oil sands and the value they hide under the surface, nothing is simple.

           <br>
          The nation’s economic and energy dependence on oil means ‘phasing out’ the oil sands is not a simple matter, and could be economically destructive. And it’s not just the oil industry that suffers during downturns; the web of the oil industry tangles throughout Canada’s economy as a whole, meaning that when oil suffers, Canadians across the country feel the effects. But concerns about long-term environmental damage and rising emissions levels are a cause of contemplation, and often, concern. The future of the oil sands - in theory and in practice - is uncertain, and the question of Canada’s energy future has not yet been answered.
          Bitumen was forged millennia ago, while the tectonic forces that formed the earth as we know it today scraped and bent and moved the planet’s surface. The forces of sustainable energy - the heat bubbling underneath the earth’s surface, the wind blowing across Canada’s golden fields and white-peaked mountains, the water streaming through Canada’s rivers, the oceans’ waves crashing and rolling in an infinite dance - have been around for just as long. The battle of which resource will win out in Canada’s energy future will determine more than the country’s economic or political path, but tell the story of our earth itself.
